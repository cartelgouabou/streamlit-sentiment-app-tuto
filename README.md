## **About This Repository**

This repository is part of a larger tutorial from my **Full Stack AI Course Project**. It serves as a **lightweight, deployable version** of the app designed to **showcase how to easily deploy a simple machine learning model online** using **Streamlit Community Cloud** (a free hosting resource provided by Streamlit).

While this repository focuses on demonstrating quick deployment, the full tutorial covers advanced topics such as **integrating Prometheus and Grafana** for monitoring machine learning model performance. For more details on setting up model monitoring and performance tracking, refer to the full tutorial linked below.
